			    <h2>John F. Mitchell and Martin Cooper of Motorola</h2>
				<p> Marty Cooper was working as an engineer in Chicago for Motorola when he had an idea.
				That idea was the spark which led to the ubiquitous handheld device which you use to check the weather,
				find out how many steps you've taken, get the results of the football match, take a selfie,
				tweet the president of the United states, upload a TikTok video and, very occasionally, 
				make a phone call. Reporter Colm Flynn met Cooper in Chicago to find out more for RTÃ‰ Radio One's History Show.
				In the early 1970s, Motorola produced radios for police and fire departments all over the world.
				They weren't a very big player in the telecom sector where the market was dominated by AT&T whose big idea was in-car phones.
                "To them, that was communications because they had been building wired telephones, and having somebody sitting in a car was a big improvement", says Cooper. 
				"To us, it was ridiculous. We'd been leashed to the wall and to our desk by that wire for over a hundred years, and now they want to leash us to our car.</p>

				<p>No, phones are a type of hardware and artificial intelligence is a type of software.
				But phones can contain artificial intelligence as part of their operating system, and indeed most modern smartphones contain some form of AI. 
				What are the 3 most easy differences between a robot and a machine.Smart machines include robots, self-driving cars and other cognitive computing systems designed to work through tasks without human intervention.
				Smart machines are digital disruptors because of the positive and negative impact they have and will continue to have on society.</p>

			    <h1 class="headings">Robote</h1>
				<p>Robots reduce human efforts and increase productivity within the workplace by taking on dangerous jobs that humans don't want to do. 
				This could be mundane activities such as vacuuming or more complex jobs like assembling components in a factory-type environment.
				Robots-as-a-service (RaaS) is a business model in which robotics companies offer the use of their robot devices via a subscription-based contract. 
				As robotic adoption increases, more and more companies are seeing the value of the RaaS model to reduce risk and provide scalable solutions for customers.</p>
